- Add built-in support for multi-stanza documents in which different stanzas
  follow different schemata? (e.g., one of the Debian source control file
  formats)

- Include utility callables for header types:
    - `BOOL` - supports yes/no, 1/0, and true/false (all case-insensitive)
    - RFC822 dates, addresses, etc.
    - Content-Type-style "parameterized" headers
        - Include an `object_pairs_hook` for the parameters
    - internationalized strings
    - converting lines with just '.' to blank lines

- Somehow support the types in `email.headerregistry`

- Add a separate "`RFC822BytesParser`" class that decodes headers (or just
  names? neither?) and leaves the body as bytes
    - Give the `parse*` methods `encoding` parameters?

- Write an entry point for converting RFC822-style files/headers to JSON
    - name: `mail2json`?
    - include options for:
        - parsing multiple stanzas into an array of JSON objects
        - setting the key name for the "message body"
        - handling of multiple occurrences of the same header in a single
          stanza; choices:
            - only use the first value for each header
            - only use the last value
            - raise an error
            - combine multi-occurrence headers into an array of values
            - use an array of values for all headers regardless of multiplicity
              (default?)
            - output an array of `{"header": ..., "value": ...}` objects
        - handling of non-ASCII characters and the various ways in which they
          can be escaped
        - folding of multiline headers
        - parsing of various structured fields (e.g., Content-Type or To)
        - handling of "From " lines (and/or other non-header headers like the
          first line of an HTTP request or response?)
        - handling of header lettercases?
